Profile in bash

## Creating a bash profile
Using the tutorial and some online sources I managed to change my standard bash interface in something more fun. Hardest part for me was searching for the right config to change. I ended up creating a new one using ```touch .bash_profile```.

I had a pretty big prompt at first so I changed it to take less screenspace (it's still pretty big when there's a lot of directories but whatever).

I feel like I got more confident in using bash during these excercises.

#### this is what my interface looks like right now:
